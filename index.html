        <p>
            I graduated with Electrical Engineering in 2024 and my interest lies
            in firmware development and embedded systems. I have done an 8 month internship
            in firmware for an engineering design consultancy as well as several firmware projects
            for my courses and hobby projects. A portfolio of my work is shown below.
